# members-only
  An express-based web application for an exclusive club-house that allows only members to see author name and timestamp of a post, while other users can only read the post and wonder who wrote them. Authorized users can become members by entering a passwod. Only admins can delete posts. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my understanding of authentication and authorization using passport.js middleware.
